# Airbnb Price Prediction

With so many people connected online, it has never been easier for people to
access crowd sharing resources online. Airbnb is one of those services, allowing
everyday people to provide short-leases on their home to practically anyone in
the world. As people tend to get a lot more space and amenities renting out an
Airbnb than a traditional hotel, itâ€™s a no brainer these types of crowd sharing
services are picking up in popularity faster than no other. However, with home
owners in charge of deciding the prices of their lease, rather than a huge
monopolistic company controlling the prices everyone pays, is there a reason to
believe that there is a trend involved in how prices are determined or is it pure
random? This article will attempt to explore this question by building a
supervised machine learning predictive model for Airbnb listing prices through
analyzing tens of thousands of Airbnb listing data gathered throughout Paris,
France.
